                                <p>This Agreement constitutes the entire understanding between the Parties with respect to any and all use of Koinly or any of the Services thereon. This Agreement supersedes and replaces all prior or contemporaneous agreements or understandings, written or oral, regarding the use of Koinly. You may also be subject to additional terms and conditions when you use or purchase certain other Koinly Services, affiliate Services, third-party content or third-party software.</p>

                                <h3 class="title">Arbitration</h3>
                                <p>In case of a dispute between the Parties relating to or arising out of this Agreement, the Parties shall first attempt to resolve the dispute personally and in good faith. If these personal resolution attempts fail, the Parties shall then submit the dispute to binding arbitration, under the Consumer Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. The arbitration shall be conducted in San Francisco, California. The arbitration shall be conducted by a single arbitrator and such arbitrator shall have no authority to add Parties, vary the provisions of this Agreement, award punitive damages, or certify a class. The arbitrator shall be bound by applicable and governing Federal law as well as the law of the state of California. Each Party shall pay their own costs and fees. Claims necessitating arbitration under this section include, but are not limited to: contract claims, tort claims, claims based on Federal and state law, and claims based on local laws, ordinances, statutes or regulations. Intellectual property claims by the Company will not be subject to arbitration and may, as an exception to this subpart, be litigated. The Parties, in agreement with this sub-part of this Agreement, waive any rights they may have to a jury trial in regard to arbitral claims - i.e. you hereby understand and agree that you are giving up your right to a jury trial or other litigation to assert any claims against the Company. Through this Agreement, you are also relinquishing any right to be engaged in a class action or other group proceeding against the Company.</p>

                                <p>Through your use of Koinly or the Services, you agree that the laws of the State of California shall govern any matter or dispute relating to or arising out of this Agreement, as well as any dispute of any kind that may arise between you and the Company, with the exception of its conflict of law provisions. In case any litigation specifically permitted under this Agreement is initiated, the Parties agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of the state and federal courts of San Francisco, California. The Parties agree that this choice of law, venue, and jurisdiction provision is not permissive, but rather mandatory in nature. You hereby waive the right to any objection of venue, including assertion of the doctrine of forum non conveniens or similar doctrine.</p>

Waiver of any part or sub-part of this Agreement will not constitute a waiver of any other part or sub-part. If any part or sub-part of this Agreement is held invalid or unenforceable by a court of law or competent arbitrator, the remaining parts and sub-parts will be enforced to the maximum extent possible.
